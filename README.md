# CIFAR10

+ In the file cifar-cnn.ipynb, I used my CNN to classify images from CIFAR-10 databases. One function using optim.SGD and other one using optim.Adam.
Adam has lower accuracy and doesn't change loss value a lot. 
+ In the file cifa-using-pretrained-ver2.ipynb, I used pretrained Densenet161 and two fully-connected, result get by this better than the before version.
